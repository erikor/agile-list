# Agile List

Typically, Agile Projects (Kanban, Scrum, etc) have one board per project, or even one board per sprint.
But what if you have a lot of smallish projects? That gets to be a lot of lists. It would be nice to be
able to have one list per project, so that one board can contain a bunch of projects. This powerup is
intended to provide reporting (Release Projection, per user stats, etc.) for a single list.
