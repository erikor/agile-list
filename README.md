# Agile List

Typically, Agile Projects (Kanban, Scrum, etc) have one board per project, or even one board per sprint.
But what if you have a lot of smallish projects? That gets to be a lot of lists. It would be nice to be
able to have one list per project, so that one board can contain a bunch of projects. This powerup is
intended to provide reporting (Release Projection, per user stats, etc.) for a single list.

You can add story points to any card by clicking the "Story Points" button. These story points will also 
be displayed in a badge on the front of the card. You can *also* add story points to checklist items 
by prepending the item with a number in brackets. (Currently these story points are not added to the 
badge total on the front of the card. Holy feature request, batman!).

You can then click on the elipsis (...) button on the list and click burndown to see how your project 
is doing. Like this:
